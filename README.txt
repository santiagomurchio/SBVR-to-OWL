SBVR To OWL
-----------
1.- The program will first ask you to enter the name of the xml file where the SBVR rules are defined. If the file does not exist, an error will be thrown.
2.- The program will ask you to enter the name of the file where the OWL will be written. If the file does not exist, it will be created. If it does exists, and it already has content, it will be overwritten.
3.- The program will ask you to enter the prefix to be used in the ontology (url).
